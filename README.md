<h2>E-commerce Website - Plantea Shop</h2>
"Plantea Shop" is a demo e-commerce website designed to showcase and sell a variety of plants. The home page, product page, and pop-up message templates were sourced from Uizard, providing a visually appealing and cohesive design concept. Building upon this foundation, I aimed to create a consistent style and atmosphere throughout the entire website, while also making strategic design decisions for other functional elements and pages.

<h3>Features</h3>
<ul>
  <li><b><i>Intuitive User Interface</i></b> 🌿 Plantea Shop prioritizes user-friendly interactions. For instance, clicking on the search bar or shopping cart automatically triggers their respective functionalities. When the user clicks outside these areas, the elements intuitively close themselves, enhancing the overall browsing experience.</li>
   <li><b><i>Blog Section</i></b> 📝 The website features a blog section where users can explore informative and engaging posts related to plants.</li>
   <li><b><i>Product Catalog</i></b> 🌱 Plantea Shop offers a wide range of demo products which are thoughtfully organized in categories and can be sorted based on various criteria, allowing users to find the perfect plants for their needs.</li>
   <li><b><i>Shopping Cart and Checkout</i></b> 🛒 Plantea Shop incorporates a fully functional shopping cart that enables users to add products, review their selections, and proceed to the checkout process. Building this dynamic feature posed challenges, but it was successfully implemented to symulate a purchasing experience.</li>
   <li><b><i>Responsive Design</i></b> 📱 Plantea Shop is built with a responsive design approach, ensuring compatibility across different devices and screen sizes. Whether accessing the website on a desktop, laptop, tablet, or mobile phone, users can enjoy a seamless and visually appealing shopping experience.</li>

<span>While it was my first time building demo-functional e-commerce website, a lot of functionalities was challenging especially shopping-cart and checkout, as well as creating dynamic routes, which render post page and product page.</span>
